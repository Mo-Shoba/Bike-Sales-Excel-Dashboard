# Bike Purchases Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Bike Purchases Dataset Analysis project! This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring bike sales data across various demographics. Please note that this is the first iteration, and additional updates will be made in the future.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to gain insights into bike purchases by examining how sales are distributed across different demographic factors, including age brackets, marital status, region, and education levels.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis can be found in the [data folder](/data). It includes detailed information about bike purchases, such as customer demographics, purchase date, and more.

## Analysis

We have performed initial data analysis and visualization to understand the trends in bike purchases. Here are some key findings:

- Sales distribution across age brackets.
- Sales distribution based on marital status.
- Regional sales trends.
- Education level and its impact on bike purchases.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to view the code and analysis.

## Next Steps

This project is a work in progress, and there are plans for further iterations and improvements, including:

- Refining data visualization techniques.
- Adding more detailed demographic analysis.
- Exploring predictive modeling to forecast future sales.

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute or provide feedback!
